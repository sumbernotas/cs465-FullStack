CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Travlr Getaways is a full-stack web application built to provide a seamless travel booking experience for customers and an administrative interface for managing trips, customers, and bookings. This project demonstrates the use of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) to deliver a feature-rich, secure application.

## Technologies Used
#### Frontend

  - Angular (SPA development)
  
  - Bootstrap (Styling and responsive design)
  
  - Angular Router (Routing between components)

#### Backend

  - Node.js (Server-side environment)
  
  - Express.js (Web framework)
  
  - Mongoose (MongoDB ODM)
  
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (Authentication)

#### Database

  - MongoDB (NoSQL database)

#### Testing Tools

  - Postman (API testing)
  
  - Angular CLI (Frontend testing and development)

## Architecture
This project uses two types of front-end development:
- Express HTML with Handlebar
- Angular Single Page Application (SPA)

The backend relies on NoSQL MongoDB databasee

## Functionality
JSON was used to serve as a data exchange between the frontend and the backend. For this project specifically, it was solely used to pass data between Angular (frontend) and Express (backend)

## Testing
- backend testing was done using Postman
- frontend testing was done manually
- security testing by using authentication layers depending on the users admin routes

  
## Reflection
This course has significantly helped me in learning more not only about the MEAN stack but how it is actually used in real-time applications. I gained experience in database management and building single page applications as well as understanding API development and testing.
